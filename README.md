# Electron Hospital Management System
This repository contains a series of tasks for a Database Management Systems (DBMS) course, focusing on the design and implementation of an Electron Hospital Management System. Throughout assignments, I used <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/sql-data-modeler/download/">Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler </a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/">Oracle SQL Developer</a>.

## üìå Logical Model Domain Overview
The system models key hospital operations:
- **Patients**: Includes PatientID (PK), Name, BirthDate, Gender, and Contact
- **MedicalRecords**: Contains RecordId(PK), PatientID (FK), Diagnosis, Date and optional 'Prescription'
- **Doctors**: Contains DoctorID(PK), DoctorName, Phone, WorkingHours
- **Services**: Contains ServiceCode(PK), Specialty, Price(Euro), DoctorID(FK)
- **Appointments**: Contains AppointmentID(PK), Datetime, PatientID(FK), DoctorID(FK), optional 'VisitReason'
- **Billing**: Contains BillID (PK), Amount(Euro), PaymentStatus, Date, PatientID(FK)
  
## üîÉ Relationships

- `Patients ‚Üî MedicalRecords` : One-to-One (Each patient has a unique medical record, and each medical record has a patient)
- `Doctors ‚Üî Services` : Many-to-Many  (Doctors can offer multiple services, and each service can be offered by multiple doctors.)
- `Doctors ‚Üî Appointments` : One-to-Many  (1 doctor can have multiple appointments.)
- `Patients ‚Üî Appointments` : One-to-Many  (1 patient can make as much as appointments (s)he wants.)
- `Patients ‚Üî Bills` : One-to-Many (1 patient can have multiple bills, for example each for different services.)
